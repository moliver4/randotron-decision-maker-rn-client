# Choices aka Randotron Decision Maker

Choices Decision Maker (previously was affectionately named Randotron thanks to a Rick and Morty Heist episode inspiration). I created this React Native app to be used on ios (mainly what I developed for) and android.
Decision fatigue is something that affects everyone on a daily basis, whether we notice it or not. There have been many studies that show professionals' decision making abilities deteriorate as the day wears on. 
Sometimes, we spend so much time deciding things relating to our job or our family, we don't want to waste any more precious energy on just deciding where to eat or what to watch. 

This is why I created this Choices App. This app is meant to help with those trivial decisions and to alleviate some awkward social situations (like deciding whose car to take or who foots the bill). 


It is absolutely not meant for huge life decisions like deciding if you should get married and all advice should be taken with a grain of salt.  


## Installation

To access the code, feel free to Fork, copy your url and ```git clone <url>```
Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install foobar.

If one choice is more heavily desired, an additional weight can be added to it and it will be taken into account. 

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
